# shoToMap
##Shot to Map is a webApp to read the exif metadata from an image an pinpoint its location on a map in realtime.
### shoToMap is using the followiing: 
#### NodeJS for the server.
#### MAPBOX for maps.
#### socketIO for the websocket.
#### exif to read the images' metadata.
#### express as a framework.
#### watchr to watch the file system when the image arraived from the client.
### This Idea can be used in many context. I'm not sure yet how i will use it in terms of production.
### Feel Free to fork this an contribute we all learning!
